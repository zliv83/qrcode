## Overview
This is my first Frontend Mentor project solution. Below you will find the stack I used as well as a link to the live site.


### Links

- Live Site URL: https://qrcode-dusky.vercel.app/

### Built with

- NextJS
- React 
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile First workflow


### What I learned

Learned that I rely on flexbox way too much. Not that it's a particularly bad thing but the Figma files were all based on absolute positioning. I also leartned that I like useing rem way more than I like pixles. I didn't convert but I think for future projects I'll create a little pxtorem function in sass.


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**
