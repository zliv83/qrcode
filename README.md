## Overview
This is my first Frontend Mentor project solution. Below you will find the stack I used as well as a link to the live site.


### Links

- Live Site URL: https://qrcode-dusky.vercel.app/

### Built with

- NextJS
- React 
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile First workflow


### What I learned

Learned that I rely on flexbox way too much. Not that it's a particularly bad thing but the Figma files were all based on absolute positioning. I also leartned that I like useing rem way more than I like pixles. I didn't convert but I think for future projects I'll create a little pxtorem function in sass.
